== RAILS Hangman

The files that you should pay attention to are ``app/controllers/hangman_controller.rb`` and ``app/views/hangman/index.html.erb``.

This app should just work by running

    bundle
    rails s


Please be aware that CSRF Protection is disabled in ``app/controllers/application_controller.rb`` :)

**Happy Hacking!**
